# Copy Guideline

This document defines the shared language patterns across the product family. All user-facing text should follow these conventions for a consistent voice and tone.

---

## Voice & Tone

- **Clear and direct**. No jargon, no filler.
- **Friendly but not chatty**. Think: a well-designed board game rulebook.
- **Short sentences**. If it can be said in 3 words, don't use 7.

---

## Headings

### Section Headings (page title, major areas)
- **Style**: Title case, no punctuation
- **Pattern**: Noun or noun phrase

### Modal Headings
- **Style**: Sentence case, no punctuation
- **Pattern**: Statement or question

---

## Buttons

### Action Buttons
- **Style**: Sentence case
- **Pattern**: First person ("I") for user choices, imperative for actions
- **Max length**: 3-4 words

### Rules of thumb for buttons
- If the user is making a choice about themselves → use "I" / "my"
- If the user is choosing something about the system → name the system
- If it's a general action → use imperative (verb first)
